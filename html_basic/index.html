            Once upon a time, there was a young man named John who had a deep interest in computer science. From a young age, John was fascinated by the way computers worked and the endless possibilities that technology offered. As he grew older, his passion for the field only grew stronger.
            
            In college, John pursued a degree in computer science and worked hard to excel in his classes. He spent countless hours studying, coding, and experimenting with different programming languages and tools. Despite the challenges he faced along the way, John remained determined to succeed in the field he loved.
            
            During his studies, John had the opportunity to work on several innovative projects that allowed him to apply his knowledge to real-world problems. He worked on developing a mobile app that helped people track their fitness goals and a web-based platform that allowed users to share and collaborate on code.
            
            It was through these projects that John discovered his true passion: using technology to make a positive impact on people's lives. He began to focus his studies on areas such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, seeking to find new ways to use these technologies to solve complex problems.
            
            After graduation, John landed a job at a leading tech company where he worked on developing cutting-edge software products. He quickly rose through the ranks, earning promotions and accolades for his innovative ideas and problem-solving skills.
            
            Despite his many achievements, John remained humble and committed to his goals. He continued to push himself to learn and grow, attending conferences and workshops to stay up-to-date on the latest trends and technologies in the field.
            
            Through his hard work, dedication, and love for computer science, John became known as one of the most talented and respected computer scientists of his generation. His story serves as an inspiration to all those who seek to make a difference in the world through the power of technology.</p>

<p> Hi </p>

<p>If you look at code for a lot of other sites, you might come across a number of strange markup styles, including attribute values without quotes. This is permitted in certain circumstances, but it can also break your markup in other circumstances. For example, if we revisit our link example from earlier, we could write a basic version with only the href attribute, like this:As written above, the browser misinterprets the markup, mistaking the title attribute for three attributes: a title attribute with the value The, and two Boolean attributes, Mozilla and homepage. Obviously, this is not intended! It will cause errors or unexpected behavior, as you can see in the live example below. Try hovering over the link to view the title text!</p>
